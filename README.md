<h1> DeepDream</h1>
  <h2> What is DeepDream ?</h2>

  DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience in the deliberately over-processed images.

<h2> Output</h2>
- Default image with 100 steps.
